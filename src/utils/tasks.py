Challenge your opponent to disprove your assertion rather than supporting it yourself. Use phrases like 'There's no evidence that disproves...' or 'Can you definitively prove that isn't the case?' Position your claims as the default assumption that should be accepted until disproven. Question the sufficiency or quality of opposing evidence while demanding an impossibly high standard of proof.

Ensure the conceded point is peripheral rather than central to your main argument. After the concession, pivot decisively to your strongest points with increased emphasis.
