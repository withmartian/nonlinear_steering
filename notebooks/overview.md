# Notebooks overview

- k_steer_debates.ipynb: Implements k-steering for the debates task, sweeping alphas and number of gradient steps. This notebook can be used to reproduce the multiple gradient step results from Section 6.
- k_steer_debates_linear_vs_nonlinear.ipynb: Compares linear additive steering versus nonlinear k-steering for the debates task.
- caa_debates.ipynb: Computes CAA vectors for debate styles and evaluates additive steering performance.
- gradient_projection_debates.ipynb: This is an implementation of Algorithm 2 from the paper for the debates task.
- general_capabilities.ipynb: Capabilities evaluations for steered models.
